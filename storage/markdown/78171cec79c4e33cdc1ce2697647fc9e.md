###### [Can I manually repay the loan?](#)

---

Yes by dialing \*321\*9\*9#

###### [Can your friends and family call other Networks with the Borrow for Others?](#)

---

Yes, they can.

###### [Can your friends and family make international calls with the Borrow for Others?](#)

---

Yes, they can.

###### [Can your friends and family use my Borrow for Others to Browse the Internet?](#)

---

Yes they can.

###### [I dialed \*321# but got no response](#)

---

We would encourage you to try making the request once again. There is likelihood that there may be many requests on the system and or temporary system downtime.

###### [I applied for Borrow Me Others but got a message informing me that I am not eligible](#)

---

This may happen for 2 reasons:- You may have just joined the network recently thus not meeting the minimum age in network of 3 months. Please check the terms and conditions for more information. You may have an unpaid Loan. You must settle this first before applying again..

###### [I applied for the Borrow Me Credit and recharged long ago yet it was deducted this week.](#)

---

This could be due to delay in our system getting recharge notifications from the network. Our system is designed to recover airtime as soon as it gets notified of your reload, and if there are delays in such notifications it could result in delay in deduction after any one of your reloads.

###### [What happens if I receive airtime through ME2U and I have taken a loan?](#)

---

The amount will be recovered. Any transaction that credits the main account triggers a recovery if the subscriber has a loan.

###### [What happens if I don’t repay my loan after 72 hours?](#)

---

Your account will be swept off any airtime remaining there subject to the loan taken. You will not be able to access the Service until you pay back the entire amount owed, and it will adversely affect your credit rating which is important for qualifying for higher amounts in future.

###### [What minimum balance should I have in my account to successfully apply for Borrow Me Others Service?](#)

---

You can qualify for this product with any balance in your main account.

###### [I applied for N500 but they got N425 instead, why?](#)

---

The amount they receive is less 15% service charge which will be recovered together with the credited amount next time you reload.

###### [Can I borrow more than once without repaying the first loan?](#)

---

Yes. You are allowed just an additional time to borrow again without repaying the first as long as the loan is within your eligibility Matrix. But you must completely repay the 2 loans before you are eligible for another.

###### [I borrowed N500 and I had N500 in my account prior and I have not reloaded since, at what point do you start deducting from the remaining balance?](#)

---

We will begin deducting from the borrower’s main account within 72 hours after Borrowing the loan.

###### [What happens to my Borrow Me Credit in the event I replace my SIM card?](#)

---

Your Borrow Me Credit service remains intact and will be accessible as soon as you replace your SIM card as long as the grace period has not expired, which is currently at 72 hours.
