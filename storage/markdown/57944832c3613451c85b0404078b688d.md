#### We’re pleased to announce the launch of a simple and very affordable 15.5k tariff plan for Glo customers.

With this new tariff, Glo customers can now call any network in Nigeria at a flat rate of 15.5k/sec. The plan is especially beneficial to customers who make a lot of voice calls and customers who currently do not have data-enabled phones and are therefore unable to enjoy Glo’s unmatched data plans.

  

Please note that this tariff offer comes with a daily access fee of N15 (excl. VAT), which is charged with the first call of the day.

  

Glo customers can join the Glo Super Talk plan by dialing [\*301#](tel: *301%23).
