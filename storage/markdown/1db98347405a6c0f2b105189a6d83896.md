Are you planning a trip and want to use Glo Mobile Device while you’re away? Get information and tips to help you stay connected, even when you’re far from home.
  
How international roaming works, and why your device matters:

1

Four frequencies (850/900/1800/1900 MHz) are used for wireless services worldwide.

2

Each phone has a radio transmitter-receiver that works on one frequency (single-band) or on more than one frequency (multi-band).

3

Since frequencies vary from carrier to carrier and country to country, you’ll need a phone or device for international roaming that works on the frequency where you’re travelling. If you have a “quad-band” device, it will work virtually anywhere there’s a wireless signal.

#### 24-hour Customer Care service for Roamers
