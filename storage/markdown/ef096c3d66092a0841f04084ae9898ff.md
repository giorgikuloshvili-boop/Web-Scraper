#### Glo Beep Call Service is an intelligent solution which enables Glo subscribers with low / zero airtime balance to reach out to any other number – both Glo and other networks in Nigeria.

This means that you can still call loved ones, friends and associates anytime you run out of airtime or exceed your credit limit. Simply call their line to leave a FLASH CALL, requesting them to call you back.

**HOW IT WORKS:** Simply call their line to leave a FLASH CALL even at zero balance, requesting them to call you back. The called party will see a missed call from you and be prompted to return your call.

It’s absolutely FREE!

This service is a first-of-its-kind and your favourite network is giving you the opportunity to not just experience it first hand, but to spread the exciting gist to all your friends.

We assure you of our commitment to always make you proud to be part of the Glo family through the introduction of game-changing services that consistently enrich the lives of our people.
