## Got Questions?

###### [What is the New Activation Offer for new Glo Router customers?](#)

---

New Activation Offer for New Router Customers: When you buy a new Glo 4G Router + SIM for ₦19,999 at any Glo World shop or authorized Glo retail outlet, you will receive Unlimited Data free for 14 days from activation. This activation benefit has a Fair Usage Limit of 100GB and is exclusive to new router activations.

###### [Who is eligible for the New Activation Offer of Unlimited Data Free for 14 Days?](#)

---

Eligibility is limited to new Glo Router activations only — i.e., customers who purchase a new Glo Router device with a new Glo SIM and register that SIM on the router at purchase.

###### [What does "Unlimited Data" mean for the activation offer?](#)

---

During the 14-day period after activation, you have unlimited data access subject to a 100GB Fair Usage Policy for the 14 days. After you exceed 100GB within those 14 days, speeds will be throttled to 2 Mbps for the remainder of the activation period.

###### [Where can I buy the Glo router to qualify for the activation offer?](#)

---

Purchase and activation must be done at Glo World shops or authorized Glo retail outlets nation-wide to qualify for the New Router Activation Offer.

###### [Can I use the Router SIM in another device to access the activation free data?](#)

---

No. The activation free data (and Router Unlimited bundles) are device-locked to Glo Routers only. If the SIM is removed and used outside the registered router device the free data or unlimited bundle will not work.

###### [What happens after the free 14-day activation data expires?](#)

---

The free activation data expires automatically after 14 days and does not roll over. To continue, you must subscribe to one of the Router Unlimited Data Bundles (e.g., the ₦19,999 or ₦29,999 monthly plans).

###### [What are the Glo Router Unlimited Data Bundles?](#)

---

These are exclusive internet plans for Glo Router customers that provide unlimited data access with a Fair Usage Policy (FUP). After you reach the FUP for your plan, speeds are reduced to 2 Mbps, but data access continues for the remainder of your validity period.

###### [Who can subscribe to these bundles?](#)

---

Only customers using Glo Router devices with a registered Glo SIM in that router are eligible. These plans cannot be used on mobile phones, MiFi devices, or other devices.

###### [Can I share the activation free data or unlimited bundle data with other Glo lines?](#)

---

No. Both the activation benefit and the unlimited bundles are locked to the registered Glo Router device and cannot be shared with other Glo lines.

###### [What happens when I reach the monthly Fair Usage Limit (FUP)?](#)

---

After you exceed your plan's monthly FUP limit (110GB for ₦19,999; 150GB for 29,999 & bigger plans), your download/upload speeds will be throttled to 2 Mbps for the remainder of the plan validity, but data access remains unlimited.

###### [What is the maximum speed I can get before FUP is reached?](#)

---

Customers may experience speeds of up to 30 Mbps prior to reaching the FUP, depending on network conditions and location.

###### [Can data from router unlimited plans be gifted or shared with other Glo lines?](#)

---

You can connect devices to the router via Wi-Fi or LAN. However, the data benefit itself cannot be transferred (gifted or shared) to another Glo SIM or used from outside the registered router device.

###### [How do I subscribe to or renew a Router Unlimited Bundle?](#)

---

You can subscribe or renew Router Unlimited Bundles via:  
1. Through \*312# USSD Buy Data Menu (Option 1 if using \*312# from Router MSISDN )  
2. Through \*312# USSD Menu (Gift Option 2, if using \*312# from any other Glo MSISDN)  
3. The Glo Café App (by adding the Glo router line as additional account)  
4. Any Glo World shop or authorized Glo retail outlet  
5. The Glo self-care portal http://hsi.glo.com

###### [Are these unlimited bundles available for non-Glo routers or other brands?](#)

---

No. These bundles are valid only on Glo-approved router models. Use of these unlimited bundles on non-Glo routers is not supported and may be blocked.

###### [Is the router activation offer available online or only in-store?](#)

---

The ₦19,999 New Activation Offer (Router + SIM + 14-day Unlimited) is primarily available in-store at Glo World shops and authorized Glo retail outlets. For online availability, check Glo's official channels for any updates.

###### [Can I transfer my bundle data balance to another Glo subscriber?](#)

---

No. The unlimited data bundles and activation benefit are non-transferable and tied to the router device and registered SIM.

###### [What happens when my bundle expires?](#)

---

When your plan reaches its 30-day validity, your connection stops working until you renew or purchase another Router Unlimited Bundle.

###### [What about coverage and signal — where do these plans work?](#)

---

These bundles operate where Glo 4G/LTE coverage is available across Nigeria. Actual speed and experience depend on local network strength and congestion.

###### [How can I monitor my data usage and FUP threshold?](#)

---

You can monitor usage through the router's admin interface, and where available, via the Glo Café App or self-care portal.

###### [Who can I contact for help, complaints or warranty issues?](#)

---

For support:  
\* Dial 300 from a Glo line for Customer Care.  
\* Visit your nearest Gloworld shop for device, activation and warranty support.
