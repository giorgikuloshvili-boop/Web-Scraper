###### [Missed Call Service](#)

Missed Call alert service allows you to receive notifications about missed calls when your phone is switched off, unreachable. Additionally, it provides notifications to your caller that the number they were trying to reach is available on the network.

###### [How it works](#)

If your phone was temporarily switched off or unreachable, after it is switched on, you will receive a text message enlisting the number of callers who tried to reach you.

If a caller's number is in your address book, an SMS sender's name will be shown as specified in your address  book. Otherwise, caller's number is displayed. If calls were made from five or more different numbers, you will receive one SMS notification from `Missed call`.

• A notification contains the following information:

• total number of missed calls.
